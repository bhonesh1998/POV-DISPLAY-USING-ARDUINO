# POV-DISPLAY-USING-ARDUINO
In this project, simple POV Display using Arduino Uno is made up.
The concept is tricking our brain to believe that an object is present while it is actually not. A POV Display or a Rotating LED Display is a simple concept where we light LEDs at a variety of sequences in order to get an illusion of a String(or Text ) being displayed.
